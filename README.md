**Repsymo Solver: How mathematical system models are solved and represented**

Currently in the design and development stage.

Go to: [2DP Repsymo Solver Web App](https://app.repsymo.com)

## Operations Research

2DP Solver is intended to improve the teaching of operations research and
make experimental studies of math solvers, CAS, arbitrarily complex systems. This is in order
to get the system model solver at production level as a long term project.
